  - David made a lot of good progress on the frontend screens. He talked about designing the screens in Figma and walked us through some of his designs as well as some prototypes too. Alan made some progress on the modelling bit of the project and finished the EDA on the chosen dataset. Fidel is still working on the setting up of the databases as far as we are aware.

  - For this next sprint, David is building out the screens for the game part of our design. Alan is finishing off the modelling process and will assist Fidel with the database setup too.

  - Nothing of note on this today.
