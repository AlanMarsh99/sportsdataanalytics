**Attendees:**  
- David Santamaria
- Alan Marsh

**Duration:**
- 10 minutes

## Agenda:

1. Discuss blockers.
2. Dsicuss work.

---

## Key Discussions:

- **Move:**
  - It was decided that we would move from Django and our PostgreSQL database to instead use Flask and the Ergast API directly. The reason for this is that our experience with Django & PostgreSQL was limited and was causing severe technical slowdowns on the backend workflow. With the new stack, we feel more confident in our abilities to perform the work required on the backend.

- **Work:**
  - David is working on the list of data we need for each screen and is working on the user evaluation plan document. Alan is working on creating the urls with flask(moved from Django) based on the screen info provided by David.

- **Blockers:**
  - Resolved the issue with the backend by changing how we do the API configuration.

## Tasks Assigned:

- **Alan:** Work on Flask implementation with the Ergast API for providing urls for David to serve data to frontend screens.
