# Supabase vs Firebase Cloud Firestore for RaceVision

When deciding between Supabase and Firebase for managing RaceVision's game logic (e.g., saving user predictions, points, badges, avatars), here's a detailed comparison considering our use of Flutter and the need for authentication:

---

## 1. Ease of Integration with Flutter
### Firebase
- Provides **first-party support for Flutter** with officially maintained libraries (`firebase_core`, `cloud_firestore`, `firebase_auth`).
- Well-documented authentication flows (OAuth, email/password, phone authentication).
- FlutterFire plugins are mature and stable.

### Supabase
- Offers a **Flutter SDK**, but it is relatively newer and may lack some features compared to Firebase.
- Simpler setup for custom solutions like magic links and OTPs, but OAuth providers require more manual configuration.

**Winner**: Firebase (due to mature tools and libraries).

---

## 2. Real-Time Features
### Firebase
- Firestore has **native real-time updates**, perfect for live leaderboards or points systems.
- Easily listen to changes in collections/documents for instant updates.

### Supabase
- Provides **real-time updates** using PostgreSQL's `realtime` extension, but it requires additional configuration.
- Works well, but not as seamless as Firestore.

**Winner**: Firebase (better native real-time support).

---

## 3. Data Structure and Flexibility
### Firebase
- Firestore is a **NoSQL database**, offering flexibility but requiring careful planning for structured data.
- Complex queries can become cumbersome or expensive.

### Supabase
- Uses **PostgreSQL**, a relational database ideal for structured data like user profiles, predictions, and game achievements.
- Relational databases simplify querying and data relationships.

**Winner**: Supabase (better for structured, relational data).

---

## 4. Authentication
### Firebase
- Out-of-the-box support for **email/password, OAuth, and phone authentication**.
- Pre-built UI libraries make setup faster.
- Tight integration with Firestore.

### Supabase
- Supports **email/password, OAuth, and phone authentication**, but lacks pre-built UI libraries.
- Simpler to implement custom flows like magic links.

**Winner**: Firebase (easier for pre-built solutions); Supabase (more flexible for custom flows).

---

## 5. Pricing
### Firebase
- Free tier available, but costs increase significantly as you scale (real-time updates and reads can become expensive).
- Authentication is free for up to 10k monthly users; additional requests are chargeable.

### Supabase
- Generous **free tier** for small-to-medium apps.
- Predictable pricing based on database size and API requests, not real-time usage.

**Winner**: Supabase (more predictable and affordable for small-to-medium apps).

---

## 6. Vendor Lock-In
### Firebase
- Heavily tied to Google's ecosystem, making migration challenging in the future.

### Supabase
- Built on open standards like PostgreSQL, making migration easier.

**Winner**: Supabase (better for avoiding vendor lock-in).

---

## Conclusions
- **Firebase**: Best for seamless Flutter integration, real-time updates, and pre-built authentication.
- **Supabase**: Best for relational data management, cost predictability, and avoiding vendor lock-in.

As David has experience working with Firebase, our project timeline is limited, and our team consists of only two members, we have decided to use Firebase Cloud Firestore for the project. Additionally, our frontend is already hosted on Firebase Hosting, which further simplifies the workflow since Supabase does not offer dedicated frontend hosting.

However, through this comparison, we have gained valuable insights into Supabase's database capabilities and the advantages and disadvantages it offers compared to Firebase. This knowledge could be useful for future projects where relational data management, cost predictability, or vendor lock-in considerations are priorities.
