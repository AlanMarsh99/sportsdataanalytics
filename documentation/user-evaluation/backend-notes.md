# Backend Development Recommendations

## Categories
- **Data Visualisation**: Enhancing the site with informative and interactive data representations.
- **User Analytics**: Implementing metrics to track and display user performance.
- **Research & Comparative Analysis**: Exploring additional features inspired by other racing platforms.
- **AI Integration**: Simplifying information delivery with automated, descriptive insights.

### 1. Data Visualisation

- **Expanded Graphs and Statistics**: Add more graphical elements and statistics to represent historical data and real-time information in the game component. This could include race results, driver/team performance over time, and comparative stats.
- **Comparative Charts**: Introduce comparative charts that allow users to view metrics such as lap times, pit stop durations, or positioning changes during a race. This would provide a more in-depth, race-specific analysis.

### 2. User Analytics

- **Success Rate for Predictions**: Calculate and display a "success rate" value for each userâ€™s predictions within the game element. This would add a competitive layer to the user experience, rewarding accuracy and allowing users to track their prediction performance over time.

### 3. Research & Comparative Analysis

- **Benchmarking Other Racing Platforms**: Conduct research to explore features from other racing platforms (such as horse racing or other motor sports) to identify unique features that may enhance RaceVision.

### 4. AI Integration

- **LLM for Site Descriptions**: Consider a simplified AI-driven solution, such as a lightweight language model (LLM), to generate brief descriptions for races, drivers, or game results. This feature could provide quick, engaging insights, but should be kept manageable and focused on adding value without overloading the backend system.
