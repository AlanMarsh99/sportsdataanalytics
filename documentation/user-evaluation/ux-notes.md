### 1. Visual Clarity

- **Race and Driver Images**: Add individual images for each race and driver to visually enrich the user experience and provide clearer, more immediate context.
- **F1 Logo on Home Screen**: Place the F1 logo prominently on the home screen to establish clear branding and help users immediately identify the app’s theme.
- **Constructor and Driver Championship Tabs**: Include dedicated tabs for the Constructor Championship and Driver Championship on the home screen to make navigation more intuitive and enable users to quickly access key content.
- **Clickable Logos on All Screens**: Display the app’s logo on all screens and make it clickable to serve as a quick navigation option back to the home screen.
- **Home Screen Direction**: Ensure clearer visual cues on the home screen to guide users towards key sections and help them orient themselves more effectively.

### 2. User Engagement

- **“Fun” Stats**: Introduce engaging and interactive statistics related to drivers, teams, and races. Fun facts or unique performance metrics can be displayed to drive user interaction and encourage return visits.
- **Space Utilisation with Images or Resized Widgets**: Fill up empty or underutilised space on pages with additional images, larger widgets, or relevant content to create a more dynamic and visually appealing layout.

### 3. Layout and Responsiveness

- **Design Strategy for Desktop vs Mobile**: Develop a clear and consistent design strategy to ensure optimal usability across desktop and mobile devices. This will involve resizing elements, adjusting layouts, and customising interaction points based on device type.
